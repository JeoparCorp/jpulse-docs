# J² Pulse
A lightweight audio/video generator that delivers daily “Jeo News” briefings — like a personal business reporter for your team.


## What is J² Pulse?

**J² Pulse** is a JeoparDIZe micro-product that automatically:

- Scans your systems for relevant updates (e.g. issues, deployments, decisions, risks).
- Summarizes them into a clear narrative.
- Generates **daily or weekly audio/video briefings** tailored to your team.
- Delivers them where people already are (Slack, email, MS Teams, internal wiki, etc.).

Think of it as your **in-house business reporter** who never gets tired of explaining what actually matters. This will be used when the team meetings will be difficult to be hold, to connect the teams and gain some time back
